## Views: index.ejs

This file contains the HTML and EJS code for your web application's main page.

### Overview

The `index.ejs` file serves as the main interface for your web application. It dynamically renders content based on the application state, such as whether the game is over, if the user needs to start the game, or during active gameplay.

### Key Components

- **Conditional Rendering**: Utilizes EJS's conditional statements to display different content based on the application state.
- **Forms**: Implements forms for user interaction, including starting the game, submitting answers, and playing again after game over.
- **Speech Synthesis**: Allows users to hear the pronunciation of words using the `pronounceWord` function.
- **Live Transcription**: Enables users to input text using speech recognition with the `liveTranscript` function.
- **Timer**: Manages a timer for gameplay, automatically submitting the form when time runs out.
- **Input Validation**: Validates user input to ensure checkboxes are selected and disallows whitespace characters.

### Usage

- **Starting the Game**: Users can start the game by selecting at least one checkbox and clicking the "Start" button.
- **Active Gameplay**: During gameplay, users input their answers in the text field and can use the "Pronounce" button to hear word pronunciation or the "Record" button to input text via speech recognition.
- **Game Over**: When the game ends, users are informed of their score and can choose to play again.

### Note

Ensure that any necessary dependencies (such as Web Speech API) are included and properly configured for the functionality to work as expected.

## .gitignore

This file specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore. It's used to prevent sensitive or unnecessary files from being committed to the repository.

### Overview

The `.gitignore` file specifies patterns which are used to exclude certain files or directories from version control. This helps keep your repository clean and focused on the important files for your project.

### Excluded Patterns

- **Logs**: Excludes log files generated during development or runtime.
- **Diagnostic Reports**: Ignores diagnostic reports generated by Node.js.
- **Runtime Data**: Excludes process IDs, seeds, and other runtime data files.
- **Coverage Reports**: Ignores coverage reports generated by testing tools like Istanbul or nyc.
- **Dependency Directories**: Excludes directories containing dependencies installed by npm, Yarn, or other package managers.
- **Cache Directories**: Ignores cache directories used by various tools like ESLint, stylelint, and microbundle.
- **Output Files**: Excludes build output, generated files, and artifacts.
- **Environment Variables**: Ignores environment variable files used for local development.
- **Temporary Directories**: Excludes temporary and cache directories used by various frameworks and tools.
- **Serverless Directories**: Ignores directories used by serverless frameworks.
- **IDE and Tool-specific Files**: Excludes files used by specific IDEs and tools like VSCode, Parcel, and Next.js.

### Usage

1. Create a `.gitignore` file in the root directory of your project.
2. Add patterns for files and directories that you want Git to ignore.
3. Save and commit the `.gitignore` file to your repository.

### Note

Make sure to customize the `.gitignore` file according to the specific needs and dependencies of your project. Review and update it regularly as your project evolves and new dependencies are added.

## index.js

This file contains the server-side JavaScript code for your web application.

### Overview

The `index.js` file serves as the main entry point for your Node.js server. It utilizes the Express framework to handle HTTP requests and responses. The application is a word chain game where users input words based on specific criteria.

### Dependencies

- **express**: Used to create the web server and handle routing.
- **axios**: Enables making HTTP requests to external APIs.
- **say**: Provides functionality for text-to-speech conversion.
- **pos**: Used for part-of-speech tagging.
- **dictionary-en**: Provides access to the English dictionary.
- **nspell**: A simple spellchecker for Node.js.

### Key Components

- **Server Setup**: Creates an Express application and sets up middleware for parsing URL-encoded data and serving static files.
- **Route Handling**: Defines routes for handling GET and POST requests, including rendering the main page, processing user input, and managing game logic.
- **Word Generation**: Utilizes external APIs and libraries to generate valid English words based on user input and game rules.
- **Error Handling**: Validates user input and provides appropriate error messages for invalid input or game conditions.
- **Text-to-Speech**: Utilizes the `say` library to pronounce words and error messages for an interactive user experience.

### Usage

1. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
2. Run the server using `node index.js`.
3. Access the application in your web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Note

- Ensure that all dependencies are installed and properly configured before running the server.
- Customize the game logic, error messages, and user experience as needed for your application.
- Review and test the code thoroughly to handle edge cases and ensure a smooth user experience.

## package-lock.json

The `package-lock.json` file is automatically generated by npm (Node Package Manager) and serves as a detailed record of the exact dependency tree for your Node.js project.

### Purpose

- **Dependency Management**: Records the exact versions of all dependencies and their transitive dependencies that were installed in your project's `node_modules` directory.
  
- **Dependency Consistency**: Ensures that everyone working on the project installs the same versions of dependencies, leading to consistent behavior across different environments.

- **Integrity Checks**: Provides integrity hashes for each installed package, ensuring that the contents of each package have not been tampered with since installation, enhancing security.

- **Locking Versions**: Acts as a lock file, preventing npm from automatically updating packages to newer versions unless explicitly instructed to do so. This helps prevent accidental upgrades to incompatible or buggy versions of dependencies.

- **Speeds Up Installations**: By storing dependency information locally, npm can avoid making unnecessary network requests to fetch package metadata during subsequent installations, speeding up the installation process.

### Usage

1. **Automatic Generation**: The `package-lock.json` file is automatically generated by npm when you run commands like `npm install` or `npm update`.

2. **Commit to Version Control**: It's important to commit the `package-lock.json` file to version control along with your other project files. This ensures that everyone working on the project is using the same set of dependencies.

3. **Avoid Manual Edits**: It's generally not recommended to manually edit the `package-lock.json` file. Any changes should be made through the npm CLI commands (`npm install`, `npm update`, etc.) to maintain consistency and integrity.

### Note

- Ensure that the `package-lock.json` file is always up-to-date with your project's dependencies. Run `npm install` whenever you add, remove, or update dependencies to regenerate the file.

- Review and resolve any discrepancies or conflicts in the `package-lock.json` file during collaborative development to avoid issues with dependency consistency.
